# Android-Inventory-Application
An Android app used to track an inventory system.

This application was designed mainly to demonstrate the use of two SQLite databases on an Android application, one database is for the Login credentials and the other is for the inventory items themselves. 

Emphasis was placed on getting the databases themselves to work properly rather than overall functionality and design. The important part is that the CRUD, Create, Read, Update, and Delete, features on the application worked appropriately. The functionality is simple and should be self-explanatory.
